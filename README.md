1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SReddy-96/TOP-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd binary-search-tree
   ```

3. Run the script (if using Node.js):
   ```
   node index.js

## sudo

first check if the array has any duplicate values
and sort the array
Using recursion and stack to build the tree

save each one to a node with value and left and right node

Set The middle element of the array as root.
Recursively do the same for the left half and right half.
Get the middle of the left half and make it the left child of the root created in step 1.
Get the middle of the right half and make it the right child of the root created in step 1.
Print the preorder of the tree.
